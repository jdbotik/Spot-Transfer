# Spot-Transfer
This is a code to show the process of transfer of money for a fictional mobile money service called 'Spot'
<h2>Description</h2>
Spot is fictional a simulated mobile money service. It is designed to mimic existing mobile money systems like MTN Mobile Money, Vodafone Cash, and Tigo Cash. With Spot, users can perform mobile money transactions, transfer funds, and engage in financial activities within the simulated environment. The project incorporates features such as visual identification through recipient images, a seamless transaction flow, and a password-based authentication system for enhanced security. It offers a secure and user-friendly environment for performing mobile money transactions, with unique features designed to enhance accuracy, convenience, and security.

<h2>Key Features</h2>

*Visual Identification:* 
Spot Transfer utilizes subprocess to open and display recipient images during the transaction process, ensuring accurate identification and reducing the risk of sending money to the wrong accounts. This will help reduce the fraudulent acts in the system.

*Seamless Transaction Flow:* 
With a user-friendly interface and efficient subprocess management, Spot Transfer enables consecutive transactions without the need to exit and restart the process. Users can perform multiple transactions seamlessly, saving time and enhancing the overall user experience.

*Password-Based Authentication:* 
Spot Transfer introduces a password-based authentication system as an enhanced security measure. Users can create and manage strong passwords to protect their accounts and ensure secure mobile money transactions. For many old users, their pins happen to be their year of birth  for easy recall. This makes it easy to be guessed as well.

<h2>Environments Used </h2>
- <b>Windows 10</b>

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>
- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>IDLE</b>

Spot Transfer is developed using Python, incorporating subprocess for image handling and an object-oriented design for efficient code management. The subprocess module is used to open recipient images and close the image viewer

Note that only option 1 and 5 work in this code. <br/>
This is what happens when the steps are followed. <br/> 
From here we can see how much is in the account. <br/>
